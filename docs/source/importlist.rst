Importing your media list
====

**Getting started**

This QRG will help you to upload your first media list into the Public Address platform, so you can distribute a campaign to this list of journalists. We support most media list file formats, but the upload works best with an XLSX spreadsheet file and supports multiple tabs, each of which can be saved as individual lists.

**Watch outs**

•	If you have any merged cells, this can create errors in your upload, so it’s best to unmerge these before you upload
•	Special formatting or symbol characters can cause errors in your upload, so remove these if you have them in your file name or spreadsheet

**Uploading your list**

To upload your first list, head to Lists Manager, and select the plus icon in the top right corner. Select ‘Upload Excel List’ and a dialog box will open where you can upload your excel media list.

.. important:: Remember – we support spreadsheets with multiple tabs so you don’t need to separate these out to create a list.

**Select Sheets**

If your media list has separate sheets or tabs, we’ll ask you to select which sheets you’d like to import, and whether you would like to create a separate media list for each sheet. If your sheet has only one tab, this step will be skipped automatically.

To select which sheets you’d like to import, click on the checkbox next to the sheet’s name and then select the highlighted orange arrow.

All sheets selected in ‘Selected sheets’ will be imported into Public Address. To import them as individual media lists for each tab, select ‘Create separate media list for each sheet.’

**Match data**

Once you’ve selected your sheets, you can click Next to match your data, a process of selecting which columns are details of each journalist.

For each column, select the relevant label to match up First Name, Last Name, and Email Address.

Once you’ve matched these columns, you’ll be able to select Next to continue matching each sheet. You’ll also see that we do our best to automatically detect the content of each column.

**Import your list**

In this final step, you’ll give each media list a name – we’ll automatically call your media list the title of the sheet that you’ve entered.

If you have multiple sheets and are creating multiple lists, we’ll give you the ability to rename each list.

Finally, you can also add tags to each journalist you’ve uploaded to categorise them as ‘Radio’, ‘Priority’ or however you’d like to tag them for your purposes.

**Final tip**

Building media lists is time consuming – why not try building a ‘Smart list’ which uses Ai to find journalists who have been writing about a set of topics recently – you can then remove anyone who’s not relevant and save time.
