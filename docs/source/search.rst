**Getting started**

The search function allows you to search for, well, just about whatever you'd want to in our database of millions of articles and tens of thousands of journalists.
The only limit is your imagination.

**The search box**

With search, you can find journalists who are writing about the topic/s that you're pitching to media. The search box itself is free text - so you can
simply enter the topic/s and hit Search Journalists or Search Coverage to find the right journalist/s to pitch too.

Selecting Search Journalists will find the journalists who are covering the topics you've searched, only displaying one result per journalist.

Selecting Search Coverage will find all of the recent coverage of the topics you've searched for, and will give you multiple results per journalist.
