The first thing you’ll notice is that our Artificial Intelligence model recommends a number of journalists to add to your campaign. Simply select the orange add button – and they’ll be added to this campaign.

You can now add journalists by searching for a media list or journalist and selecting the 'Add Contact' button. You can choose to schedule each list and media contact for the appropriate time using the clock icon next to Add Contact.

If you ever want to pull these up, just select the magic wand in the top right, and you can add individual journalists.

You’ll also note that we warn you if a journalist email is out of date, and specifically whether it has bounced, or the journalist hasn’t written any articles recently.

By selecting the checkboxes on the left, you’re able to turn notifications or private mode on and off, change the date/time a pitch is to be sent and delete selected journalists from your campaign.

Now you can click on any of the journalists in your campaign to edit the specific pitch to this journalist. You’ll notice that when you pull up the pitch, you’re able to see the journalist’s recent articles on the right-hand side.

Any edits you make to your pitch will only apply to the individual email that will be sent to this journalist and you can edit the subject line and body of the pitch.

.. important:: Once you’re done editing your pitches, you can click ‘Send Now’ or if it’s scheduled, ‘Schedule Send.’ We’ll display a final confirmation message to make sure you’re ready to go – then you can confirm and we’ll send your campaign out.
