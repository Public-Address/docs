**Creating a new campaign**

Getting started

This QRG will help you to send your first campaign out through Public Address.

Watch outs

•	Give yourself time to create your first campaign by using the scheduling function to send your emails the next day

Creating your campaign

To create your campaign, you need to enter:

•	Campaign Name: An internal name for your campaign that will make sense to you and your colleagues – journalists don’t see this
•	From: Select which email address you want to send your campaign from
•	Select list or enter contacts: Start typing to find media lists to distribute to, or start typing a journalists name to add them to the campaign
•	Subject line: Just like a regular email subject line

Great – you’ve now got your campaign set up. You’ll now want to add content to your campaign.

You’ll see that we’ve started your pitch with Hi \|First Name\|, which is our handy mark down functionality –  markdown is text where we automatically prefill your email with the journalists first names from your media list.

You can then start typing your pitch into Public Address, further utilising any markdown shortcuts such as role, publication, section or first name. Remember that this is the pitch that you’ll be able to edit in the next step, so don’t overly personalise it here.

You’ll also see that there are a number of buttons down the bottom of your campaign set up.

•	Turn on notifications: Allows you to turn on notifications for the whole campaign, so you’re notified via email or SMS for every open
•	Turn on private mode: Restrict other users on your platform from viewing this campaign
•	Use a press release: Insert an HTML press release
•	Send test email: Send yourself a preview email to check formatting
•	Add attachments: You can upload attachments to your email. If it’s larger than 3mb, we’ll automatically send this as a link rather than a traditional email attachment so you don’t get caught up in spam
•	Save as draft: Saves a draft of your campaign
•	Schedule campaign: You can choose any time in the future to distribute your campaign
•	Send Now or Edit Pitches: If you’re pitching one journalist, you can hit ‘Send Now’ to immediately send your pitch. Otherwise you can select ‘Edit Pitches’ to be able to further customise each individual email pitch

Fantastic – you’ve now set up your first campaign – before you send, you’ll want to edit your pitches as this can increase the number of replies you get by 300%.

Edit pitches

The first thing you’ll notice is that our Artificial Intelligence model recommends a number of journalists to add to your campaign. Simply select the orange add button – and they’ll be added to this campaign.

If you ever want to pull these up, just select the magic wand in the top right, and you can add individual journalists and additional lists using the plus button.

You’ll also note that we warn you if a journalist email is out of date, and specifically whether it has bounced, or the journalist hasn’t written any articles recently.

By selecting the checkboxes on the left, you’re able to turn notifications or private mode on and off, change the date/time a pitch is to be sent and delete selected journalists from your campaign.

Now you can click on any of the journalists in your campaign to edit the specific pitch to this journalist. You’ll notice that when you pull up the pitch, you’re able to see the journalist’s recent articles on the right-hand side.

Any edits you make to your pitch will only apply to the individual email that will be sent to this journalist and you can edit the subject line and body of the pitch.

Once you’re done editing your pitches, you can click ‘Send Now’ or if it’s scheduled, ‘Schedule Send.’ We’ll display a final confirmation message to make sure you’re ready to go – then you can confirm and we’ll send your campaign out.

Final tip

The more pitches you customise – the greater your open and response rate will be. So squeeze out every last drop of customisation you can to ensure that your campaign is going to create as much engagement as possible!
