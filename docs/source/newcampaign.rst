Creating a new campaign
====

This guide will take you through setting up your first campaign on Public Address.

**Watch outs**

•	Give yourself time to create your first campaign by using the scheduling function to send your emails the next day

**Creating your campaign**

To get started, select 'New Campaign' from the Left Hand Side Navigation Bar.

To create a campaign, you need to enter:

•	Campaign Name: An internal name for your campaign that will make sense to you and your colleagues – journalists don’t see this
•	From: Select which email address you want to send your campaign from
•	Select list or enter contacts: Start typing to find media lists to distribute to, or start typing a journalists name to add them to the campaign
•	Subject line: Just like a regular email subject line

Great – you’ve now got your campaign set up. You’ll now want to add content to your campaign.

You’ll see that we’ve started your pitch with Hi \|First Name\|, which is our handy mark down functionality –  markdown is text where we automatically prefill your email with the journalists first names from your media list.

You can then start typing your pitch into Public Address, further utilising any markdown shortcuts such as role, publication, section or first name. Remember that this is the pitch that you’ll be able to edit in the next step, so make sure your pitch is broad enough to be customised for each recipient.

Once you've completed drafting your pitch, you’ll notice that there are a number of buttons down the bottom of your campaign set up.

These buttons allow you to set a number of additional features according to your preferences:

•	Turn on notifications: Allows you to turn on notifications for the whole campaign, so you’re notified via email or SMS for every open
•	Turn on private mode: Restrict other users on your platform from viewing this campaign
•	Use a press release: Insert an HTML press release
•	Send test email: Send yourself a preview email to check formatting
•	Add attachments: You can upload attachments to your email. If it’s larger than 3mb, we’ll automatically send this as a link rather than a traditional email attachment so you don’t get caught up in spam
•	Save as draft: Saves a draft of your campaign
•	Schedule campaign: You can choose any time in the future to distribute your campaign
•	Send Now or Edit Pitches: If you’re pitching one journalist, you can hit ‘Send Now’ to immediately send your pitch. Otherwise you can select ‘Edit Pitches’ to be able to further customise each individual email pitch

Fantastic – you’ve now set up your first campaign – before you send, you’ll want to edit your pitches as this can increase the number of replies you get by 300%.

**Final tip**

The more pitches you customise – the greater your open and response rate will be. So squeeze out every last drop of customisation you can to ensure that your campaign is going to create as much engagement as possible!
