Connecting your Gmail Account
-------

To connect your email account, head to the settings drop down menu and select ‘Integrations’. Select the + sign on the right hand side of "email address" and click "Add my own email" from the drop down menu.

A pop will then appear asking you a few different email options. Select **'Connect with Google'.**

A pop up will open where it will ask you to select the account you want to connect, or enter an email address if you haven’t logged in on your browser previously.

Enter your email address and select ‘Next.’ You’ll now be prompted to enter your password, and then hit ‘next’.

You’ll now be asked to provide your permission for Public Address to be able to read and send email on your behalf – this is an important aspect of this integration as it allows you to send emails via the Public Address platform. These emails will then show up in your outbox and if you have a premium subscription we’ll be able to incorporate replies to these emails into the platform.

Please hit accept, and then you’ll be redirected back to the user settings page and this dialog box will close.

If your platform has been configured correctly you’re all set to go. If you see a ‘This app isn’t verified’ warning from Google your platform or domain administrator haven’t configured the application correctly. To learn more about this error view our help article here.
