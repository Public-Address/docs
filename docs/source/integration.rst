A pop up will open where it will ask you to select the account you want to connect, or enter an email address if you haven’t logged in on your browser previously.

Enter your email address and select ‘Next.’ You’ll now be prompted to enter your password, and then hit ‘next’.

You’ll now be asked to provide your permission for Public Address to be able to read and send email on your behalf – this is an important aspect of this integration as it allows you to send emails via the Public Address platform. These emails will then show up in your outbox and we’ll be able to incorporate replies to these emails into the platform.

.. _SMTP:

Connecting your SMTP Account
-------
First of all, you’ll require your SMTP/IMAP settings – every email server supports these and you can find them in a couple of ways. The easiest is to head to your account settings in Outlook or your email account where they’ll be displayed.

These are also accessible on your phone – so you can head to the settings of your emails on your phone and find these there as well.

If you know your email provider, you can also search for this on the internet and they will typically have these settings displayed somewhere on their website.

Of course, the recommended way ahead here is to ask your friendly IT support person to send these settings to you. You’ll need an IMAP Host and port, SMTP Host and port, and whether to

Once you’ve received these settings, you’re ready to go!

Hit Connect your email to start the process, and fill in the required fields.

A note about your password – you can definitely use Public Address with any IMAP/SMTP account, including google or microsoft, however, you may need to set a application specific password up for these accounts depending on your organisation’s security settings. We’ve got a great article on application specific passwords here.

Once you’ve entered those details please select ‘Test Connection’ – Public Address will then test the connection with your email server, which can take up to 60 seconds, before displaying a confirmation message that we’ve been able to successfully connect to your account.

Of course if you experience any difficulty with any this set up process, our support team is standing by using the message icon in the bottom right corner, on 1300 158 048 or via support@publicaddress.com.au
