Using the Newsdesk
=======

**Getting started**

This QRG will help you to make the most out of the Public Address Newsdesk, where you can check in on the status of any of your campaigns.

**Watch outs**

•	You’ll need to have sent a campaign to make use of this guide – otherwise it will just show your draft campaigns

**Introducing your Newsdesk**

Your Newsdesk is the home for all of your draft, in progress and completed campaigns. When you first navigate to the Newsdesk, you’ll see all of your campaigns on the left, and Recent Activity on the right-hand side.

You can use the search box to find any recent campaign, and by selecting a campaign using the checkbox, you can copy this campaign, archive it so it doesn’t display in your campaign view and mark the campaign as completed. You can also use the filter to select campaigns that meet certain criteria.

When you select a campaign, the Recent Activity view will only show activity – opens, link clicks, notes and replies - for that campaign, and using the arrow on the right-hand side of your campaign you can see a summary of activity for each campaign. Selecting two or more campaigns allows you to merge them.

By selecting a campaign, you can access Campaign View.

**Campaign View**

Campaign View provides you with an overview of every email sent to contacts within your campaign.

You can search for a specific journalist, or filter the Campaign View by the status of a pitch. The buttons on the right-hand side allow you to download a report on the campaign, copy the campaign to send to another list of journalists, copy the journalists you’ve sent the campaign too to a new campaign or add lists/ or individual journalists to your campaign.

By selecting one or more pitches, you can follow up with journalists in bulk using the Follow Up button. Follow Up opens an email pitch that you can send to one or multiple journalists, that you can customise using the ``|First name|`` markdown field.

Selecting any campaign will open Pitch View.

Pitch View

In Pitch View, you can view detailed tracking data on each campaign, all replies, notes, follow up with journalists and communicate with your team.

The navigation bar on the top allows you to quickly navigate between pitches and campaign view, while Log New allows you to log emails, phone calls and messages you’ve had with the journalist. The Assign To button allows you to assign the pitch to yourself or colleagues.

On the right hand side you’ll see a number of additional actions that you can take. You can assign coverage, mark the journalist as contacted via phone, forward the correspondence to a colleague and turn notifications or private mode on and off. You can also manually set the journalist interest level for the pitch to indicate how interested they are.

The campaign tags box allows you to add a tag to the journalist for that campaign – for example their level of interest. In the Internal note box, you can add a note about that pitch, or tag a colleague using the @ symbol to automatically notify them via email.

The email reply box allows you to reply to the journalist’s most recent correspondence from within the Public Address platform, and Recent Activity shows all activity with that journalist, on that campaign.

Finally, by selecting View Contact, you can view the journalist’s contact card on Public Address and all of their recent campaigns and activity.

**Final tip**

While you can reply directly from your email, replying from within the Public Address platform provides tracking and engagement data for each email reply. While it’s a little extra effort to send the reply from within the platform, it provides a substantial benefit.
