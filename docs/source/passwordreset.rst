How do I reset my password?
-------

We’ve all been there. It’s pretty easy to forget your password and get locked out of an account.

Don’t worry – it’s super easy to reset your password. You can go to app.publicaddress.com.au and select ‘Forgot Password’, enter your email address, and we’ll send instructions to your email address.

If you’re a platform owner, you can also select the lock icon next to a user to send them a password reset email.
