How do I pause a scheduled campaign or pitch?
-------

**Getting Started**

You've written up an amazing campaign to be pitched and scheduled it to send out next Friday. You realise the campaign needs to be sent out earlier instead. Luckily, the scheduled campaign can still be paused in the Newsdesk.

**Watch Outs**

* Pausing a scheduled campaign or pitch will turn it into a draft and you can make any changes once you click into the draft.
* Selecting the **'Scheduled'** status under **'Any Status'** will only show the Scheduled campaigns.
