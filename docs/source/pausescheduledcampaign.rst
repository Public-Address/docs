**Pause a Scheduled Campaign**

First thing you will need to do is go into your Newsdesk and then find the scheduled campaign either by searching for the campaign name or manually looking for it. You can also change the status to only show Scheduled campaigns on the Newsdesk as mentioned above.

Once you have found the campaign you would like to pause, select the checkbox¹ next to the campaign and click the Pause Sending option² on the top right next to search.
